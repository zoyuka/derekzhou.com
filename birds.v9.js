/* Birds — a sky.

   The owner, verbatim: "The page should be a sky so like they're flying
   across/in patterns/etc. it should feel calm - not bouncing off the
   walls." ... "should b rand". Of v3's rows: "Are you sure this is how
   birds movement is flying?!" Of v4: "Y they all look same and move all
   the same?" And of v7: "Y is the movement so 2D though."

   EVERY BIRD ITS OWN DRAWING. The tattoo is the hand, not a stamp. Traced
   from the photo, each of its three birds is an "M" gull stood on a steep
   diagonal: from the back, a rise to the first wrist, a drop to the body,
   a rise to the second wrist, and a long stroke out in front (the
   long-tailed one draws its back wing out as a tail). Along the diagonal
   the rises read as risers and the drops as treads: steps. Every bird is
   drawn afresh in that hand (drawBird): its own strokes, its own lean, now
   and then a tail, in its kind's proportions (a gull long in the wing, a
   finch small and neat, a heron trailing its legs).

   THE SKY IN DEPTH. The window is a camera looking out over a sea of
   cloud and up at the sky (FOV across its longer side, the horizon a
   fifth of the window's height above its bottom edge, or lower where the
   words come down that far), and every flight flies a path in the air
   in front of it, nearer than any cloud; the sky behind (the sky's script) is
   drawn through the same camera, lent to it (skyAir.aim):
   straight, or wheeling through a banked turn, climbing or sinking a
   little; across the window mostly, now and then angling away from it,
   seldom coming nearer. All that is seen is that air in perspective. A
   bird's size, its pen and its ink are its distance, worked out afresh on
   every drawing: nearer is larger, bolder and blacker; a flight going away
   shrinks, slows on the window and sinks toward the horizon, and far off
   pales and fades into the distance rather than popping out; one coming
   nearer grows, never faster than a calm eye allows (looming pulls the
   eye). A V lies level in the air, foreshortened, its near arm larger and
   higher; a pair flies one nearer, one farther; a loose flock is a cloud
   with depth; a line undulates in the air. A turning bird banks: its inner
   wing drawn lower, its outer higher (never a rotation). Soaring birds
   circle a thermal in the air, a ring seen from below, climbing as it
   drifts downwind.

   EVERY KIND ITS OWN FLIGHT (Pennycuick 2001 and the sources in
   CLAUDE.md): geese beat on and on in V's and J's; ibis flap and glide in
   lines, the glide passing back down the line; gulls flap a few times and
   glide long, wheeling; a heron rows by on slow, deep beats; crows row
   straight; finches bound, a few quick beats up and a fall with the wings
   shut; swallows glide and flicker, wheeling; storks circle a thermal.
   Speed is in spans a second, so a flapping bird covers about its own span
   a beat (flapping that goes nowhere reads as treading air). The calm
   comes from glides, few birds and empty sky, not from slow wings.

   EVERY BIRD MOVES ON ITS OWN: its own rate and point in the beat, its
   own flap-and-glide, its own drift about its place over a few seconds.
   No skein is where a ruler would put it, and none is fixed: now and then
   a scatter gathers into its V as it crosses (the pattern finding them),
   or a V loosens.

   THE SKY. Every flight enters from beyond one edge already flying (a 1 s
   fade softening the entry), or out of the distance, and leaves beyond an
   edge or into the distance; nothing starts, stops, loops or turns back in
   view. A path is planned whole before its first bird enters: clear of the
   name, bio and credit and of the footer links for the whole crossing,
   clear of every other flight, one flight to a band.

   THE HAND: every mark drawn afresh 12 times a second (on twos), its
   vertices re-jittered 6 times a second (the boil). Through a beat the
   wrists swing down across the bird's own line and back up (M, flat, W,
   flat, M) and the body lifts a little on the downstroke. As drawn a bird
   faces right, rising the way the tattoo's do; flying left mirrors it.
   Never rotated.

   THE WEATHER (=rand()): ONE crypto draw at init, above INIT-END, and no
   clock at all; splitmix32 streams from it: the front and its facets, the
   season, and every flight's own stream (its kind, its birds, their
   drawings). There is no other randomness.

   prefers-reduced-motion: a still sky, a photograph. A hidden tab pauses
   with requestAnimationFrame; a step is capped at STEP_MAX. No DOM is
   built: the twelve SVGs are in index.html; this draws their strokes and
   moves them. */
